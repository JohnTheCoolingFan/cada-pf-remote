Attempted to scan for wifi devices from a pc using an external usb dongle in monitor mode and wireshark.

Tried settings channels to 1, 6 and 11. 6 didn't capture any data, channel 1 and 11 only captured nearby wifi devices such as routers and smartphones, nothing that would correlate with me starting and stopping pairing mode of the remote and/or receiver.

This leads to a conclusion that CaDA uses a custom protocol that is not wifi.
